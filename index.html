		<H3>1ST STANZA</H3>
		<P>
        Tell your goodnight to the light and close your eyes<br>
        There's a better place for you than to stay awake<br>
        You'll get closer to a paradise of dreamers in love<br>
        You'll get better like heaven has done something<br>
        </P>
		
		<H3>BRIDGE</H3>
		<P1>
		So lay now, I'll take over the night<br>
        There's no teardrop, you can count on me tonight<br>
        Or I'll stay up with you<br>
		</P1>

		<H3>CHORUS</H3>
		<P2>
		Baby it's alright<br>
        I'll be right by your side<br>
        No need to cry out loud<br>
        Nothing to cry about<br>
        Baby it's alright<br>
        I'll be just by your side<br>
        I'll keep you on my sight<br>
        I'll never leave 'til you sleep tonight<br>
		</P2>
		
		<H3>2ND STANZA</H3>
		<P3>
		I'll cover you with my arms and hold you tight<br>
        I'll be listening to your wonderful and calm little voice<br>
        I'll keep watching 'til my eyes burn down<br>
		<strong> REPEAT CHORUS </strong>
		</P3>
		
		<H3>2ND BRIDGE</H3>
		<P4>
		I'll never sleep, I'll never leave<br>
        I'm gonna chase this dream tonight<br>
        I'll never leave, I'll never<br>
        I'll never go...<br>
		REPEAT 1ST BRIDGE AND CHORUS AFTER ADLIB
